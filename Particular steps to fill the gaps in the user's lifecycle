Missing Step: User Modification
Description: User modification refers to the process of making changes to a user's access rights and permissions after the initial provisioning. 
This step is essential because user roles and access requirements may change over time due to various factors such as job role changes, project assignments, or changes in security policies.
Actions:
Define a clear process for requesting and approving changes to user access rights.
Implement procedures for modifying user accounts, roles, and permissions based on approved requests.
Ensure that user modification requests are subject to proper authorization and validation.
Maintain an audit trail of user access changes for compliance and security monitoring.
